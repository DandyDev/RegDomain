RegisteredDomain
================

RegisteredDomain is a simple library to extract the hostname from an URL in a consistent manner. It is based on the PHP version of the [reg-dom-libs](http://www.dkim-reputation.org/regdom-libs/). The License is kept from the original, because the code hasn't changed much, except for making it PHP5.3 compatible, removing deprecated short-style PHP tags, and putting it under Composer package control.

I will try to keep it updated as new TLDs get added.
